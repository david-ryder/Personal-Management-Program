This is a personal management system completed as an OOP project for our Java programming class

Per our professor's directions, we needed to create 3 objects - Student Staff and Faculty

This program is set up to create 2 Students, 1 Staff, and 1 Faculty

The user can enter in the data for each of these objects, print their information, or calculate a student's tuition invoice based on the cost per credit hour and number of credit hours that a student is taking
